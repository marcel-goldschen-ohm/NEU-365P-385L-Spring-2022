## Objective

*The ability to read and write are obvious fundamental skills critical to all academic and quantitative pursuits.* **Fast approaching this level of fundamental importance is the ability to write computer programs to analyze and manipulate data sets ever increasing in richness and size.** This skillset is necessary to work with a wide array of systems whose models and behavior are sufficiently complex to make analysis by hand intractable.

**In this course you will translate problems into code applying modern approaches for data analysis, statistical inference and modeling to various levels of neural systems and their component behavior.** We will use Python as a coding environment, and you will be exposed to resources and options for scientific computing.

 *Although geared for neuroscience, the approaches covered in this course are highly salient for a wide array of applications.*

 ## Breadth over Depth

We will cover a wide array of topics rather than explore any one topic in great detail. Topics will be introduced at a level where you should be able to understand each concept and put them to use. However, realize up front that we may have only scratched the surface.

*The goal of the course is to give you enough of a basic toolset that you will have the necessary foundation to develop programs for any concept that you understand.*

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for the course. *However, you are expected to be familiar with basic mathematical functions and concepts, and you will be asked to perform quantitative calculations and to think critically.* **This is NOT an easy course.**

## Requirements

You must `bring a laptop to class` for hands on participation. If you do not own a laptop, contact your department or the College of Natural Sciences to obtain a loaner for the duration of the course. Install Python 3.x, Conda and JupyterLab PRIOR TO THE FIRST CLASS. See the installation instructions near the end of this document.

Other than that you should be motivated, prepared to work hard, respectful and help to foster an inclusive environment.

Finally, I want you to have fun and learn a lot!

## Academic Integrity

It is perfectly fine to work with your fellow students or anyone else on the homework assignments. If you do so, please include a note on your assignment indicating with whom you collaborated (`see Homework Collaboration below`). Any academic dishonesty such as copying a fellow students assignment without collaborating in its completion will be severly punished as outlined by the University. **Most importantly, the ability to solve problems such as those in the homeworks is exactly the skillset you are here to obtain.** By not practicing these skills, you are primarily hurting yourself.

## Inclusion

Along with the entire Department of Neuroscience, this course embraces a notion of an intellectual community enriched and enhanced by diversity along a number of dimensions, including race, ethnicity and national origins, gender and gender identity, sexuality, class, ability level, and religion. We are especially committed to fostering an environment where you feel heard and respected in your courses.

## Course Details

* Time: TTH 2:00-3:30 PM
* Location: BUR 208
* Instructor: Marcel Goldschen-Ohm
* TA: Ashray Saxena

## Contact

Please contact myself or the TA via `Canvas`.

## Office Hours

Office hours are `Zoom only`. See `Canvas` announcement for times and Zoom links.

### I'm confused, but my schedule makes attending office hours difficult. What do I do?

Post your questions on the `Discussion Board` (see below) where either myself or your fellow students can help. I may not reply immediately as advice from fellow students can often be the most illuminating.

## Discussion Board

See Canvas for a link to the discussion board.

:bangbang: Every time you interact with the discussion board in a meaningful way, you will receive `one point of extra credit`. Myself and the TA will decide what constitutes 'meaningful'. I realize this is subjective, but in general it includes asking a question, answering a question, or contributing addtional information or resources relevant to the course. Also, do not purposely attempt to break up your responses into many tiny chunks. All responses regarding a particular topic will together be considered as a single interaction. This extra credit will be tabulated weekly and points added within Canvas.

## Policies

Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic accommodations from the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, [Services for Students with Disabilities](http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/) (471-6259).

## Grades

:bangbang: Homework constitutes the majority of your grade, so it is imperitive that you complete the homework on time in order to do well in this course.

    A: 90-100%
    B: 80-89%
    C: 70-79%
    D: 60-69%
    F: <60%

Depending on the distribution of scores, I may alter the above ranges to normalize to the difficulty of the assignments. If I do so, `any alteration will only be favorable to you` and never unfavorable. Note that in the case that I do change the ranges, I will NOT apply a curve to the letter grades. `I am very happy to give everyone an A if possible.`

## Grading Rubric

Most questions will be worth 3 points for which the grading rubric is:

    +1 point for a remotely valid attempt
    +2 points if there are only minor mistakes
    +3 points if appropriately addressed

## Homework :pencil2:

Most homework will be in the form of Jupyter notebooks.

Homework assignments will be posted on `Canvas` where you will be required to upload the completed notebook file. Be sure to include your full name in the filename of each of your assignments (e.g. `assignment-your_full_name.ipynb`).

Homework is predominantly weekly, and you will usually have one week to complete the assignment. All homework is `due by midnight on the due date`. Note that uploading to Canvas can sometimes be less than instantaneous, so `don't wait until one minute before midnight to submit`. Late homework is not acceptable.

:bangbang: The course is fast paced, so keeping up with practicing the nearly weekly homework is critical for your success.

:warning: If you clone this repository, be sure to `move the homework files outside of your cloned folder` before you work on them. Otherwise, the next time you sync with this repository `your homework will be overwritten with blank assignments`! You don't have to worry about this if you download the files manually.

:warning: I reserve the right to alter any of the homework files anytime prior to their assignment. If you opt to complete any of the assignments ahead of time, it is up to you to check for any changes at the time of assignment.

## How to manually download Jupyter notebook homework files

1. Navigate to the `*.ipynb` Jupyter notebook file in this repository.
2. Right-click on the `Raw` button above the file preview and `download` the file.
3. In JupyterLab, navigate to the file and open it.

:warning: In the past some people experienced that their downloads were treated as text files with an extension of `.ipynb.txt`. If this happens you will not be able to open the file in JupyterLab until you `remove the .txt` extension so that the file has the proper extension of `.ipynb`.

## Homework Collaboration

You are `allowed to collaborate` with your classmates on homework assignments unless otherwise indicated. If you do so, you `must include the names of everyone you collaborated with` at the very beginning of the assignment. For Jupyter notebooks, please `insert a new first Markdown cell` with all `collaborators names in a bulleted list` like this:

* collaborater 1
* collaborator 2

:bangbang: It is imperitive that both collaborators have each others names in their respective lists. Any academic dishonesty such as copying a fellow students assignment without collaborating in its completion will be severly punished as outlined by the University.

## Topics Map

![Topics Map](images/topics-map.png)

## Syllabus

:warning: The syllabus is unlikely to change much, but I reserve the right to tweak and change it as we go along, so check back often. This is so I can offer you a more polished experience by adjusting to your performance and feedback throughout the course. Note that this also includes homework assignments (see Homework above).

## Install Python and JupyterLab (required)

This is not the only way to install and/or manage your Python environment, but it is the method I recommend for this course.

1. Download and install Miniconda from https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html. Choose the latest version of Python 3. Miniconda installs the Conda package manager which manages all of your Python packages. It comes with a minimal set of basic packages, but there are also additional packages that we will need for this course. I will walk you through installing most of those packages as they are needed, but you should install JupyterLab right away (see next step).
2. Install JupyterLab. After you have installed Conda (previous step) you should now be able to use the `conda` command in a Terminal (MacOS), shell (Linux), or command prompt (Windows). Run the command `conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab` by typing it into your command line interface and pressing Return or Enter. This will install the JupyterLab package which is the user interface environment in which we will be spending most of our time. You can test whether this worked by running the command `jupyter-lab` which should open up a page in your web browser with the JupyterLab user interface.
