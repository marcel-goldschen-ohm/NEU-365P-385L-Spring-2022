Make sure your axes limits are the same for all plots so that it is visually obvious what is going on. Label your plot axes appropriately and indicate the time step in the plot titles. *Hint:* I did not cover 3D scatter plots in class, so you'll have to research this on your own. There are plenty of Matplotlib tutorials for 3D scatter plots out there. Or feel free to use a different plotting package if you want."

For example, if a walker attempts to move from (0.1, 0, 0) to (-0.2, 0, 0), that walker should end up at (49.8, 0, 0). The same behavior in all dimensions. Also plot your results as in #3 above."
